## üè® Project Overview

This project presents an innovative deep learning approach to revolutionize fluid dynamics simulation in boutique hotel development. By combining **Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)** neural networks with the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**, we achieve significant computational speedups while maintaining accuracy in HVAC system optimization, thermal comfort analysis, and building airflow simulation.

### üéØ Key Achievements
- **10-100x faster** predictions compared to traditional CFD methods
- **Real-time physics-informed** fluid dynamics simulation
- **Cost-effective** design iteration for $10M+ hotel projects
- **Enhanced operational efficiency** through optimized HVAC systems

## üöÄ Executive Summary

Developed for MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning (6.S191) course, this project addresses critical challenges in boutique hotel development where traditional CFD simulations are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Our ConvLSTM-LBM hybrid approach combines:

- **Spatial Feature Extraction**: CNNs capture complex geometric patterns in hotel layouts
- **Temporal Dynamics**: LSTMs model time-dependent fluid flow behaviors  
- **Physics-Informed Learning**: LBM provides physically consistent fluid dynamics
- **Real-time Optimization**: Enables rapid design iteration and system optimization

The solution targets the substantial financial burdens associated with design iterations, system optimization, and operational costs in hotel development, offering potential savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars per project.
